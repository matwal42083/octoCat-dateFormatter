## What is it?
I built A simple date format along with freeCodeCamp as an assignment. The program formats today's date
between day/month/year, year/month/day, month/day/year, hours, and minutes. It is just another JavaScript practice.
## stack that I used:
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * JavaScript
   
## Why would this be beneficial for JavaScript practice?
 * To learn different ways to format date, and time, down to minutes and seconds
 * To learn how to format dates and times with JavaScript
 * Learn different ways to handle dates and times formatting
 * Learn how to make a clock and calendar
